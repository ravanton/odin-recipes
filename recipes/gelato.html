            <h2>"Ingredients"</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 medium egg yolks</li>
                <li>150 g (3/4 cup) of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>350 ml (1 ½ cup) of whole milk</li>
                <li>250 ml (1 cup) of heavy cream</li>
                <li>A little grated lemon zest or vanilla extract (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>"Steps"</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1 – Whip the egg yolks with the sugar at maximum speed for about 5 minutes, until you have a soft fluffy cream. You can use a stand mixer or an electric hand mixer. You can even beat them by hand with a whisk, but you need more time and the result is not as perfect as with the electric mixer.</li>
                <li>Step 2 – Meanwhile, pour the milk in a saucepan and bring it almost to a boil. Cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Step 3 – At this step, transfer the egg and sugar fluffy cream to a saucepan. Pour the hot milk slowly. Keep mixing while you do it. In this way you are also pasteurizing the eggs. With the exception of flour, the procedure is similar to that of Pastry Cream recipe. If you want to flavor your gelato, this is the time to add either grated lemon zest or two drops of vanilla extract or vanilla bean. Now put it back on the heat and cook for another 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Step 4/1) Now if you have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into the machine and start it. It will take about 40 minutes, depending on the model. After the necessary time, your gelato is ready! Fresh, creamy and nutritious.
                    Read how to store it in the paragraph below.If you don’t have an gelato maker, in the next paragraph we’ll show you how to make ice cream without an ice cream maker
                    Pour the mixture into a gelato container and place it in the freezer for about 5 hours. Every 30 minutes you have to break the frozen surface. So remove from the freezer and mix for about 30 seconds using a hand whisk or an electric whisk on low speed. This step is necessary in order not to create ice crystals in the gelato and have a creamy result. Of course this is a bit more laborious process, but it’s worth it. You will surely have an exquisite authentic Italian Gelato!</li>
